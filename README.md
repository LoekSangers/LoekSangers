### Hi, I'm Loek Sangers

I am a teacher and coach for the Open-ICT bachelor program at Utrecht University of Applied Sciences (Hogeschool Utrecht). In this work I get to guide students into becoming IT professionals. The program is structured in sucha way that students work in teams on real projects. We work with SCRUM and every two weeks the students have to show their progress to either their internal Product Owner (i.e., a teacher), or their external Product Owner from the company that facilitates their project. Next to this, I get talk with every student I coach at least once every two weeks in a one-on-one session to discuss their progress and check how they are doing. Next to coaching, I also am part of two Guilds, Backend and Computer Engineering. These Guilds are the knowledge centers for the roles that students can choose in our program, where we share knowledge and review work. For more information about this program see the [website](https://husite.nl/open-ict/) (in Dutch).

My interest in the Computer Science domain are relatively broad, but a short list of topics that interest me is:
- Cloud:
  - I setup a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster at home using two old laptops and play around with this
  - I have plans to host my own app on this which will incorporate a Frontend, Backend, and Database all hosted on my own cluster
- Home Automation:
  - I run a Raspberry Pi with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) OS
   - Made a [contribution](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/63218) to the Google Assistant integration to allow local fulfillment of requests
- Enterprise Integration:
  - As a Technical consultant at [Avanade](https://www.avanade.com/en) I worked a lot with Azure components for integrating [Dynamics 365 F&O](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/) with other systems, mainly worked with:
   - [Azure Logic Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview)
   - [Azure Service Bus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview)
   - [Azure Blob Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction)
- Game Development:
  - During my bachelor program at Utrecht University I followed the Game Technologies track, which basically means all my projects were about making games :D
  - Game AI:
   - [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/home): Currently using this with students to explore AI topics. 
  - [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5): Starting up a project with a friend to develop a game in UE5
- Robotics:
  - This is an interest of mine, but I do not know a lot about it yet :)
  - I do get to explore this interest by facilitating the Computer Engineering Guild where I learn as much from the students as I can teach them.

This all I do using the following languages (in order of mastery/usage):
- Python
- C#
- Typescript
- Rust
