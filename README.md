### Hi, I'm Loek Sangers

I am interested in many things, but at the moment my main focus in exploring the Cloud and what all I can do with this. For this purpose I have set up a Kubernetes cluster on an old laptop and am playing around with that. In this exploration I would like to document what I am doing so I can reproduce it at a later time or can refer people to it. 


## Interests:
- Integrating (Enterprise) Systems
- API Development
- Game AI
- Cloud Development
- Internet of Things
- Home automation/Smart Buildings/Smart Cities
